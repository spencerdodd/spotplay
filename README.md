# SpotPlay

This project is a bot written in python that scrapes posts in reddit.com/r/electronicmusic searching for Spotify
playlists. When it finds a Spotify-hosted playlist, it scrapes the songs from the playlist and rehosts them on a
Google Play Music playlist.

## Requirements

- [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) for Spotify API interaction
- [gmusicapi](https://github.com/simon-weber/gmusicapi) as an unofficial Google Play Music API
